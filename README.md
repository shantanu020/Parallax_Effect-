This repository demonstrates the implementation of a **Parallax Scrolling Effect** for enhancing web page aesthetics. The project is part of **Hacktoberfest 2024**, an open-source contribution challenge, so feel free to contribute and improve the project.

## Overview

The **Parallax Effect** in web design allows background images or elements to move at a slower pace than the foreground content, creating a sense of depth during scrolling. It's widely used for adding interactivity and a modern look to websites.

## Features

- Customizable parallax speed for background elements
- Supports smooth scrolling animations
- Fully responsive and cross-browser compatible
- Easy integration into any front-end project
